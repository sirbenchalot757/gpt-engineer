These are strings of emails that need to be cleaned up and formatted into JSON. Format each email as a separate JSON object with the following keys: 'date', 'to', 'from', 'subject', and 'body'. Ensure all dates are in ISO 8601 format with time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS). Correct any spelling errors or nonsensical content in the emails. Omit unnecessary data such as signatures, disclaimers, warnings, and other extraneous information.

You may encounter text that is not an email such as diagnostics or system messages, just ignore these.

The JSON format should strictly adhere to standard JSON syntax. Each email should be a distinct object within an array, separated by commas. Do not start JSON objects with '{{[' or end them with ']}}'. Use proper JSON array notation for multiple emails.

Example of correctly formatted JSON:
[
  {{
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS",
    "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
    "from": "sender@example.com",
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "body": "Email body text."
  }}
]

Here is an email:
{text}

Please format this email as a JSON object within an array. Ensure the response is strictly valid JSON.
